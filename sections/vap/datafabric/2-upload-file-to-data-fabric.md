# Upload your file to Data Fabric
[Previous - Introduction](1-introduction.md)

The tutorial will assume you have Data Steward access to the Data Fabric container you want to pull data from in Data Fabric. For details on how to use access control in Data Fabric, see the <a href="https://developer.veracity.com/services/datafabric">Data Fabric Documentation</a>.

Make sure you have uploaded at least one file to your Container. We will use myContainerData.csv as an example though out this tutorial.
