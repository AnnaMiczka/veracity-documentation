# Introduction: How to connect to Data Fabric


Welcome to this step-by-step guide on how to connect your VAP service to data fabric. The tutorial consists of the following steps.

When you build a Power BI report on top of data from Veracity Data Fabric, the data source, access key and file name are stored as settings in your Power BI report. The Veracity Data Fabric container access key used when building the report has a maximum validity of 6 months. Once the key in your report expires, it will not be possible to refresh the report. Here you will learn the steps you have to take to make sure VAP can always update your report. 

This tutorial uses Power BI 2.4.
